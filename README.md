### Project Title
Gerardo's Dessert Stand

### Description
In this project, I built a storefront application using JavaScript, focusing on essential e-commerce functionalities. I created a product list using object literals and implemented a shopping cart that allows users to add, increase, decrease, or remove items. The checkout process calculates the total amount due and processes payments, displaying any change needed.

Key features include:

* Adding products to the cart
* Adjusting item quantities
* Removing items from the cart
* Calculating cart totals
* Managing payment transactions

### Files Used
* script.js (for core functionality)
* front.js (for user interaction)
* styles.css (for styling)
* Local images (stored in the images folder)

### Requirements
JavaScript (ES6)
